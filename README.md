# CS Mentor Frontend - Progress Report ðŸŽ¨

## **Current Phase: Frontend Development & UI Implementation**
### **Overview:**
This phase involved designing and implementing a dynamic and user-friendly **React.js** frontend for the CS Mentor AI system. The frontend communicates seamlessly with the backend to provide a smooth chat experience for users, enabling them to ask theoretical Computer Science-related questions and receive AI-generated answers.

## **What Has Been Completed:**

### 1. **Chat Interface Design:**
- Developed a responsive **ChatBox** for displaying messages between the user and the AI.
- Added dynamic status messages:
  - **"AI is thinking now..."**

- Ensured smooth transitions and animations to enhance user experience.

### 2. **Session Management:**
- Implemented the ability to:
  - Create new sessions via the **"New Chat"** button.
  - Switch between active sessions.
  - Restore deleted sessions from the **History** page.
- Provided functionality to delete sessions and clear the entire history.

### 3. **Auto Save Feature:**
- Added a toggle button to enable/disable automatic session saving:
  - **Enabled**: All session data is saved locally for future access.
  - **Disabled**: No data is saved after the browser is closed.

### 4. **Clear History:**
- Implemented a "Clear History" feature:
  - Deletes all active and deleted sessions.
  - Displays a system message confirming the successful clearing of history.

### 5. **Dark/Light Mode:**
- Designed a **toggle button** to switch between dark and light themes dynamically.
- Ensured all components adapt seamlessly to the selected theme.

### 6. **Help Page (Tutorial):**
- Created a comprehensive **Help page** accessible via the Sidebar:
  - Explains how to use the application effectively.
  - Provides examples of how to ask questions to the AI for optimal responses.
  - Highlights the AI's capabilities and limitations.

### 7. **Error Handling:**
- Added meaningful error messages for:
  - Connection issues with the backend.
  - Invalid or unprocessable user inputs.
- Ensured that users are informed when the AI cannot process a question.
