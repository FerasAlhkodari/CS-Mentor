Computer Science is the study of computation and information. Key topics include:

Algorithms: An algorithm is a well-defined, step-by-step process or set of rules to solve a specific problem or achieve a desired outcome. Algorithms are the foundation of computer science and are widely used in:
- Data processing
- Searching
- Sorting
- Optimization tasks

Key characteristics of algorithms:
1. Finite: Has a clear beginning and end.
2. Precise: Every step is well-defined and unambiguous.
3. Input and Output: Takes input and produces output.

Examples:
1. Quick Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm used for efficient sorting.
2. Binary Search: An algorithm to efficiently find an element in a sorted array.

Algorithms are essential for solving computational challenges in an efficient and structured manner.

Data Structures: Methods of organizing and storing data such as arrays and linked lists.

Object-Oriented Programming: A programming paradigm based on objects containing data and code.

Algorithm complexity is measured using Big O notation, such as O(n) for linear complexity.

Databases: Systems for efficient data storage and retrieval.

Computer Networks: Study of how computers connect and exchange information.

Operating Systems: Software that manages computer resources and provides interfaces for users and applications.

Cryptography: The science of protecting information using mathematical algorithms.

Artificial Intelligence: The study of making machines simulate human intelligence.
